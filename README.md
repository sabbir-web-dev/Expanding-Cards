It seems like you've provided an HTML document along with JavaScript and CSS code for implementing expanding cards. However, it appears there's an issue with the placement of your JavaScript code within the HTML file. Your JavaScript code should be placed before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure that the elements it references are already loaded in the DOM.

Here's the corrected structure for your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Expanding Cards</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="content active" style="background-image: url(Images/photo1.jpg)">
      <h3>Forest Bridge</h3>
    </div>
    <!-- Add other content divs here -->
  </div>
  <script src="/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Ensure that your JavaScript code is placed in the `index.js` file and that it looks like this:

```javascript
const contents = document.querySelectorAll(".content");

contents.forEach((content) => {
  content.addEventListener("click", () => {
    removeActive();
    content.classList.add("active");
  });
});

const removeActive = () => {
  contents.forEach((content) => {
    content.classList.remove("active");
  });
};
```

Also, it seems you've requested assistance in writing a README file for explaining the expanding cards project in detail. Here's a template for that:
